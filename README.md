# YarrrTube

Because YouTube Red pisses me off, I decided to see if I could gen up some handy dandy scripts so I could just STEAL from them and really lay into the big corporations. Please peruse to your heart's content.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/chacei/YarrrTube.git
cd YarrrTube
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install yt-dlp
```

Use the instructions below for the things you would like to download. Once finished, you may run `deactivate` to exit out of the virtual environment. If you wish to download more videos at a later date, run `source venv/bin/activate` from the repo home directory to re-enter the virtual environment before running scripts.

## Live-to-MP3

This is a script that converts any YouTube Live videos to MP3s. Audio only, so handy for podcasts and such.

To use, simply run `python3 Live-to-MP3.py` and follow the instructions to download your Live audios.
